Build a React-Redux App - CRUD
ðŸ‘‹ hi there! My name is Vinod Chauhan and this is the source material for Build a ReactJS Redux App!

All Contributors PRs Welcome Code of Conduct

To verify things are set up properly, you can run this:

git --version
node --version
yarn --version # or npm --version
If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment variable and how to fix it here for

Setup
You should be able to work through the entire workshop in the browser. This is actually the recommended approach as it requires absolutely no setup whatsoever. Go to this codesandbox and you should be good to go.

https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vinodchauhan7/React-CRUD-using-Redux

If you'd rather be able to work on your own computer, then follow the following instructions.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

# If you were given instructions for a specific branch to use, then use this command
# git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> https://github.com/vinodchauhan7/React-CRUD-using-Redux.git

# otherwise, this is fine:
git clone https://github.com/vinodchauhan7/React-CRUD-using-Redux.git

# then do this:
cd folderName
npm install
npm start
This may take a few minutes. If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what the problem is. You may also want to look at Troubleshooting. If you can't work it out on your own then please file an issue and provide all the output from the commands you ran (even if it's a lot).

Running the app
To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

npm start
This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard react-scripts application.
